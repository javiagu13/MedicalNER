Medical NER Detection and Semantic Type Classification Using MedMentions Corpus with Flair

All BIO from medmentions has been processed and extracted in the three different BIO folders (semantic types, CUI and medical term) 

Three different ipynb files:

	medNer-> it performs term detection and also extracts the previously explained term detection BIO
  
	medNer_SemanticType_version-> it performs semantic type and also extracts the previously explained semantic type BIO 
  
	medNer_CUI_version-> it performs UMLS task, however due to colab limits it could not have been executed :(

paper.txt, to perform tests.

Medical_NER_Detection_and_Semantic_Type_Classification_Using_Flair.pdf is an unpublished paper for this work.

corpus_pubtator are the files from original medmentions corpus.
